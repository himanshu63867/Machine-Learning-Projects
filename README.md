### 4. üí≥ Credit Card Fraud Detection
**Goal:** Detect fraudulent transactions in an imbalanced dataset.  

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled class imbalance using **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** and under-sampling.  
- **EDA:** Analyzed transaction patterns and correlations between features.  
- **Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost.  
- **Evaluation:** Focused on **Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC** (since accuracy is misleading in imbalanced data).

 ### 5.  **Predictive Analytics for Identifying Sales & Supply Chain Problems (FMCG)**

**Goal:**  
Build a machine learning model that predicts potential issues in FMCG sales such as stockouts, delivery delays, and ineffective promotions before they happen.

**Steps Involved:**  
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning FMCG sales data (2022‚Äì2024), handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and removing data leakage features.  
- Feature Engineering: Extracting date-based features (month, day, day-of-week), region, channel, price, and promotions.  
- Model Building: Training Random Forest / XGBoost classifier to predict "problem" vs "no problem".  
- Evaluation: Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and feature importance analysis.  
- Insights: Identified which factors (pricing, region, promotions) contribute most to sales/supply chain problems.

**Outcome:**  
This model serves as an **early warning system** for FMCG companies, helping them proactively address sales risks, optimize promotions, and ensure better product availability.
