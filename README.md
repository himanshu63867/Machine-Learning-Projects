# Machine-Learning-Projects

In the Sonar Rock and Mine Prediction project, I applied machine learning techniques to classify sonar signals into two categories: "rock" or "mine." This project involved:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing the sonar dataset to ensure it's ready for model training.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gaining insights into the dataset using statistical summaries and visualizations.
Machine Learning Models: Implementing classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees, and Random Forests to build and train predictive models.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and fine-tuning them for better generalization.
Feature Importance: Analyzing and selecting the most influential features to improve model interpretability and accuracy.
Through this project, I enhanced my skills in applying machine learning to solve real-world problems, focusing on predictive analytics and classification in geophysical exploration.
